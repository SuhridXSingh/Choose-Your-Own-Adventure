# Choose your own Adventure: A Text-Based Adventure Game ðŸŒ²

A simple, choice-driven adventure game that runs in the terminal. The player wakes up lost in a forest and must make a series of decisions to survive and find their way back to safety. This project was built to practice creating branching narratives with Python.

## Features

-   **Interactive Story:** An engaging narrative where the player's choices directly shape the outcome.
-   **Branching Paths:** Multiple decision points lead to different scenarios and endings.
-   **Case-Insensitive Input:** Uses the `.lower()` method to accept a variety of user inputs (e.g., "Open" and "open" are treated the same).
-   **Multiple Endings:** The game has win and lose conditions based on the path the player chooses.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository or download the `.py` file.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the script with the command:
    ```shell
    python choose_your_own_adventure.py
    ```

## Concepts Learned

-   **User Input:** Capturing player choices using the `input()` function.
-   **Nested Conditional Logic:** Using nested `if/elif/else` statements to create a complex, branching storyline.
-   **String Manipulation:** Handling case-insensitive input with the `.lower()` string method.
-   **Variable Management:** Storing player answers and choices in variables to guide the game's flow.
